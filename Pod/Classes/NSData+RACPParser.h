/**
 `NSData+RACPParser` provides record access control point (RACP) response parsing
 */
@interface NSData (RACPParser)

/**
 Parses an RACP response and provided the details in a dictionary using keys from the `RACPConstants.h`
 
 @return Dictionar of the RACP response details
 
 @discussion The RACP reponse has two formats; 1) an RACP number of records response or 2) RACP general response. Helper methods are available in `[NSDictionary+RACPExtension]` to interprete the dictionary.
 
 @discussion The number of records repsonse includes the number of records for the request in the `RACPNumberOfRecords` field and the report number of records reponse op code in the `RACPResponseOpCode`

    Example:
    {
        "RACPResponseOpCode": 5,
        "RACPNumberOfRecords": 10
    }
 
 @discussion For the general response, the op code for the RACP response is in the `RACPResponseOpCode` field with the response details in the `RACPResponseCodeDetails` field. The response details includes the requested op code in the `RACPResponseRequestOpCode` field and the response code value in the `RACPResponseCode` field.
 
    Example:
    {
        "RACPResponseOpCode": 6,
        "RACPResponseCodeDetails":    {
            RACPResponseRequestOpCode: 1,
            RACPResponseCode: 1
        }
    }
